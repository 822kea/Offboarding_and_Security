# The Importance of Off-Boarding  
*(Another Real-Life Example)*  

What is off-boarding, and why is it important in regard to information security?  

Off-boarding is the process, usually handled by HR and/or IT, of removing an individual’s access to organizational resources. Whether the employee quit or was fired, if they no longer affiliate with the company, they shouldn’t have access.  

This is important because, let’s say an employee was fired and felt upset. If they still had access to company resources, they could potentially do a lot of damage. For example, they might leak confidential information stored on drives or gain physical access to the building to destroy servers.  

This came to mind because I recently moved out of an apartment I shared with another person. They decided to stay in the building, and I moved completely out. Well, due to poor practices by the leasing office, my name ended up on my old roommate’s new lease, AND I still had access to the building!  

This could have been a dangerous situation. Imagine if my previous roommate and I were on bad terms—I would still have access to their space and could wreak havoc (thankfully, we’re cool tho ☺️). But do you see how important proper off-boarding is?  

Even small things, like removing someone’s access to a building, are critically important! Everyone plays a role in keeping a company and its people secure. Always pay attention to detail and think of the bigger picture!
